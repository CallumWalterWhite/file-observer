# FileSorter (WIP) - might turn into a bit of a rip off of File juggler

FileSorter is a Python application designed to automate the tagging and organization of files in directories. It allows users to define rules for tagging files based on specific criteria and then move them to designated target directories.

## Reason
Created this because it was a pain to keep track of my downloads folder and etc, so keeps everying clean.

## WIP
make it work for MacOS
working on install
